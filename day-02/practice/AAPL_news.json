Known for its roaring petrol engines, Ferrari has sold hybrid models since 2019 and will begin unveiling its first EV in October this year in a three-stage process culminating in a world premiere in the spring of next year.  Aside from the lack of a throaty roar that comes with an electric sports car - the top selling point for many wealthy buyers - automakers have struggled to overcome the fact that EV batteries are far too heavy and simply lack the sustained power of a fossil-fuel engine."
